# RELEASE NOTES: #
==================

v4.0.0
- fixed a bug in Google Chrome 70 that can cause the app to completely lose its configuration
- changed how the app works for increased flexibility and performance
- Added investigation dashbaord

v3.3.6 
- Row reordering feature added to 'Configure Broken Hosts Lookup' page. Can drag rows using the 'Comments' column.
- 'Add New Suppression' button added to top right to make more visible.
- Ability to Copy formatted row data to clipboard
- Added expectedTime_tmp for backup purposes. 
  - In edge cases where KV Store is being updated after a row-reorder on Configure page and user refreshes, KV Store data could be lost.
For this reason, every change made backs up the current version to a expectedTime_tmp KV Store first
  - On initial load of the table it will check if expectedTime is empty, if it is it will then check expectedTime_tmp for data and use
that as a backup in case the KV Store was emptied. If both are empty then it is assumed this is a new install and the user has an option
to add default values to the KV Store.

- New dashboard: "Configure Broken Hosts Lookup" allows for CRUDing expectedTime KV Store
   - Applies validation to help ensure proper values are added into the lookup
   - Table highlights when two conditions are met:
